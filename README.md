# WhoAmI
In this project i will publish my own website about me, the project's name is a wink from the command "whoami" of linux

## Why
Well I start this project to show to people who is Ismael Matiz, offer to the companies and to other developers my skills 
also practice some knowledge about Front-end a Back-end development, if you want to gain a place in this industry and 
if you're studying by yourself you should create a portfolio, well every developer should create a portfolio, 
but especially the autodidact people

## How is the project structured?
I've created an instance in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), installed Apache2, set up the security group and firewall permissions, and then voilÃ  
I got a link to get access to my site on every device around the globe, special thanks to 
- [MINTIC](https://www.mintic.gov.co/portal/inicio/)
- [Universidad Sergio Arboleda](https://www.usergioarboleda.edu.co/)
- [This post from Parzibyte](https://parzibyte.me/blog/2020/05/01/crear-ec2-ubuntu-server-aws/)

they give the fundamentals about how to publish a website in the internet like a HackerðŸ˜Ž, and then using git and GitHub 
i connected the website that I have on my local with the virtual instance in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), you can see my website [here](http://54.232.168.229/)
